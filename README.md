# Netflix-Capital-Budgeting-Model

Action:
Conducted a 5-year financial projection for Netflix, including revenue, expenses, and profitability trends.
Performed Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) valuation using Free Cash Flow to Firm (FCFF) and Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC).
Calculated Beta (Regression & Bottom-Up) to assess systematic risk and improve cost of equity estimation.
Analyzed historical financial statements (Income Statement, Balance Sheet, and Cash Flow) to evaluate profitability and liquidity.

Outcome:
Derived a target valuation based on projected FCFF and discounting at WACC.
Identified revenue growth trends, profitability drivers, and key risk factors affecting Netflix’s valuation.
Determined the impact of cost of capital on Netflix’s future cash flows.

Recommendation:
Netflix should focus on subscription revenue growth while optimizing content production costs.
Strengthen financial efficiency by reducing debt reliance and improving operating margins.
Maintain competitive pricing strategies to sustain long-term profitability and market share.
